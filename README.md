# Big Day Tutorials
Templates &amp; Tutorials for Data Science Projects

# Overview

This repo is full of Jupyter Notebook templates and tutorials for a wide range of Data Science projects.  My goal in developing this library is to increaese our collective productivity and ability to solve a range of problems across industries.

# Features

Each notebook is essentially a lesson that teaches you the concepts as well as the Python code to complete each task.  Notebooks also include video tutorials and practice challenges so you can gain more familiarity and confidence.
